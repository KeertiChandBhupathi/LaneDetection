# LaneDetection
Lane Detection code developed for my Masters Thesis.

/input directory contains files of bigger size which delay the cloning of this repository, but in-turn provides exact source used for tuning the program so users can get started quickly.

/LaneDetection contains python code used to perform lane detection on pre-recorded videos containing simulated lanes in laboratory.

Three different kinds of approaches are used for lane detection: sliding window, clustering and augmented sliding window approaches.
